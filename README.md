# Crypto-Transaction-Risk-Classification
Risk classification in cryptocurrency transactions is important because blockchain networks lack central oversight making them vulnerable to money laundering, fraud, and scams. As crypto adoption increases, financial institutions and exchanges must detect suspicious transactions at scale. Classifying transaction risk helps flag potential illicit activity early and supports compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations. Building an reliable multi-class risk classifier can help platforms, regulators, and users identify and respond to suspicious activity more intelligently.

The Elliptic dataset is a graph-based time-series dataset where Bitcoin transactions form nodes in a temporal transaction graph, with each node described by 166 numerical blockchain features.
